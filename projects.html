                <b>Project: JourneyPack (AI-Powered E-commerce Store)</b><br><br>
                In our final Project of WBS Coding School Boot Camp, we created an e-commerce store with the name of JourneyPack.
                <br>
                <br> JourneyPack is an innovative e-commerce platform that tailors shopping experiences based on travel plans. It collects user inputs such as destination, timing, activities, and preferred hotel type. Leveraging AI, the platform generates a personalized list of recommended items, factoring in the activities and destinationâ€™s weather conditions during the selected time frame. It also suggests hotels matching the user's preferences, allowing them to view and purchase relevant products directly from the store.
            <br><br>
            As a full-stack developer on this project, my key contributions included:
            <br><br>
            1. Designing and managing the MongoDB database to store users, products and ordered data.
            <br><br>
            2. Collaborating with team members to develop APIs using Express for data handling and user interactions.
            <br><br>
            3. Creating visually appealing and interactive "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages to enhance user engagement.
            <br><br>
            4. Designing the JourneyPack logo and developing the Footer section for consistent branding across the platform.
            <br><br>
            Technologies used: HTML, CSS,Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Git, GitHub, Netlify, and Postman.
            <br><br>
            The project is currently hosted on Netlify and can be accessed at: https://journeypack.netlify.app/
